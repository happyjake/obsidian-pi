# Changelog

## 0.0.5

- Added a Pi executable path setting so custom installs such as nix-darwin can point Obsidian directly at the Pi CLI. (#15, #16)

## 0.0.4

- Added support for finding Pi CLI installations that use the `pi-node` launcher on Ubuntu/Debian systems. Thanks @Hatekaharja! (#10)

## 0.0.3

- Simplified context settings by removing user-facing numeric context/change tracking limits and keeping ignored folders/directories as the visible context/file-access control. (#3)
- Changed pre-attached context to avoid automatic broad prompt searches; Pi now starts from current-note, link/backlink, and explicit attachment context while tool-enabled modes can explore further with Pi read/search/list tools. (#3)
- Documented the issue, branch, changelog, and manual release-prep process for future changes. (#3)
- Fixed CI format checks for optional local docs and agent guidance files. (#3)
- Improved Pi CLI dependency diagnostics for missing Pi installs, missing Node runtimes, and startup failures. (#6)
- Added safer Pi subprocess PATH handling for Obsidian GUI launches on macOS and common Node version managers. (#6)
- Updated Pi setup guidance to explain Node/PATH issues when the Pi CLI is installed but cannot run. (#6)
- Started smarter change tracking that snapshots Pi-touched files for Edit mode while keeping full snapshots as a Full agent fallback. (#4)
